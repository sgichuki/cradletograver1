title: About

I earned a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Connecticut where my research was focused on atmospheric mercury pollution in the environment.My postdoctoral work focus was on greenhouse gas emissions from industry, notably the fossil fuel industry and the waste industry. I have worked on projects in South Africa, Bermuda, the US, Canada and France. Data analysis has always been an integral part of my work using different tools from Microsoft Excel to R and Python. I enjoy programming and the control and versatility it provides in how one can work with different kinds of data. I enjoy being able to explore data on different topics from science, business, education, health, & the arts.
This site is a showcase of snippets of code used to visualize different kinds of data. It is a work in progress
